## What You'll Learn

- How to create custom Docker images based on PHPeek
- Advanced PHP and Nginx configuration techniques
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security hardening for production deployments
- Troubleshooting complex issues

## Prerequisites

Before diving into advanced topics:

1. Comfortable with Docker and Dockerfiles
2. Completed at least one [framework guide](../guides/_index.md)
3. Running PHPeek in development successfully
4. Basic understanding of PHP-FPM and Nginx

## When to Use Advanced Topics

- **Extending Images**: Need PHP extensions not included by default
- **Custom Extensions**: Building specialized extensions or compiling from source
- **Custom Initialization**: Complex startup requirements or migrations
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimizing for high-traffic production workloads
- **Security Hardening**: Preparing for production deployment

## Best Practices

### Testing Custom Images

Always test custom images locally before deploying:

```bash
# Build custom image
docker build -f Dockerfile.custom -t my-app:dev .

# Test locally
docker run --rm -p 8000:80 my-app:dev

# Verify extensions
docker run --rm my-app:dev php -m
```

### Version Pinning

Pin specific versions in production:

```dockerfile
# ✅ GOOD: Pin specific versions
RUN pecl install redis-6.0.2

# ❌ BAD: Use latest (unpredictable)
RUN pecl install redis
```

### Documentation

Document all customizations in your repository:

```markdown
# Custom Image Documentation

## Added Extensions
- Redis 6.0.2 (caching)
- MongoDB 1.20.1 (database)

## System Packages
- ffmpeg (video processing)
- node 20.x (asset compilation)

## Configuration
- PHP memory_limit: 256M
- OPcache enabled with validation
```
