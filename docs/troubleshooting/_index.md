## Quick Diagnosis

### Container Won't Start

```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs app

# Common causes:
# - Port already in use
# - Volume permission issues
# - Invalid configuration
# - Missing dependencies
```

→ See [Common Issues - Container Problems](common-issues.md#container-problems)

### Application Not Accessible

```bash
# Verify container is running
docker-compose ps

# Check port mapping
docker-compose port app 80

# Test locally
docker-compose exec app curl http://localhost
```

→ See [Common Issues - Connection Problems](common-issues.md#connection-problems)

### PHP Errors

```bash
# View PHP error log
docker-compose logs app | grep -i error

# Check PHP-FPM status
docker-compose exec app ps aux | grep php-fpm

# Verify PHP configuration
docker-compose exec app php -i | grep error
```

→ See [Common Issues - PHP Problems](common-issues.md#php-problems)

### Database Connection Failed

```bash
# Check database is running
docker-compose ps mysql

# Test connection from app
docker-compose exec app nc -zv mysql 3306

# Common causes:
# - Wrong DB_HOST (should be service name, not 'localhost')
# - Database not ready yet
# - Wrong credentials
```

→ See [Common Issues - Database Problems](common-issues.md#database-problems)
