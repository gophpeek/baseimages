3. Have your framework application ready (or create a new one)

## Common Patterns

All framework guides follow these principles:

- **Copy-paste ready examples** - All code works without modification
- **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, add features incrementally
- **Real explanations** - Understand WHY, not just WHAT
- **Expected output** - See what success looks like
- **Inline troubleshooting** - Common mistakes with solutions
- **Production ready** - Configuration suitable for real deployments
