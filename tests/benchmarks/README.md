# PHPeek Performance Benchmarks

Performance benchmarking suite for PHPeek base images.

## Benchmark Suite

### 1. Image Size Comparison
Measures and compares:
- Uncompressed image size
- Compressed image size (gzipped)
- Storage efficiency across tiers (slim, standard, full)

### 2. Container Startup Time
Measures:
- Time to container ready (average of 5 runs)
- Standard deviation for consistency
- Health check response time

### 3. PHP Performance
Tests:
- Operations per second (array operations benchmark)
- Memory usage patterns
- OPcache effectiveness
- JIT compiler impact

### 4. HTTP Request Performance
Benchmarks:
- Requests per second (RPS)
- Average latency
- P95 latency (if Apache Bench available)
- Nginx + PHP-FPM throughput

## Running Benchmarks

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required tools
- Docker
- bc (basic calculator)
- jq (JSON processor)

# Optional (for better HTTP benchmarks)
- Apache Bench (ab)
```

### Build Images First
```bash
# Build all tiers
docker build --target root -t phpeek-bookworm -f php-fpm-nginx/8.3/debian/bookworm/Dockerfile .
docker build --target slim -t phpeek-slim -f php-fpm-nginx/8.3/debian/bookworm/Dockerfile .
docker build --target full -t phpeek-full -f php-fpm-nginx/8.3/debian/bookworm/Dockerfile .
```

### Run All Benchmarks
```bash
./tests/benchmarks/run-benchmarks.sh
```

### Run Individual Benchmarks
Edit `run-benchmarks.sh` and comment out unwanted benchmarks in the `main()` function.

## Benchmark Results

Results are saved to `tests/benchmarks/results/` with timestamps:

```

## CI/CD Integration

Benchmarks run automatically in GitHub Actions on:
- Every push to main/develop
- Every pull request
- Manual workflow dispatch

### View Results in GitHub Actions
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Integration Tests" workflow
3. Click on latest run
4. Download "benchmark-results" artifact

### Benchmark Artifacts
GitHub Actions uploads results as artifacts:
- Available for 90 days
- Downloadable as ZIP
- Contains all markdown reports

## Interpreting Results

### Image Size
- **Slim**: ~120MB - Best for size-constrained environments, APIs/microservices
- **Standard**: ~250MB - Balance of size and features (default)
- **Full**: ~700MB - Includes Chromium for Browsershot/Dusk

**Recommendation**: Choose slim for microservices, standard for most apps, full for browser testing.

### Startup Time
- Differences typically 10-30% between tiers
- Slim usually fastest due to smaller size
- Consider warmup time in production (not just cold start)

**Recommendation**: Startup time differences minimal in production with warm containers.

### PHP Performance
- Performance similar across tiers (~2-5% difference)
- Additional extensions have minimal runtime overhead
- Application code has more impact than tier choice

**Recommendation**: PHP performance differences negligible for most applications.

### HTTP Performance
- Nginx performance consistent across tiers
- Network overhead typically dominates request latency
- Application code has more impact than base image

**Recommendation**: Tier choice has minimal impact on HTTP performance.

## Benchmark Limitations

### What These Benchmarks Don't Measure
- Real application performance (use your own benchmarks!)
- Database query performance
- External API call latency
- Complex business logic performance
- Production load patterns

### Factors Not Included
- Multi-core scaling
- High concurrency scenarios (>1000 concurrent)
- Long-running request behavior
- Memory pressure under load
- Network topology impact

### Recommendations for Production
1. **Run your own benchmarks** with your actual application
2. **Test under realistic load** matching your traffic patterns
3. **Measure end-to-end** including databases, caches, APIs
4. **Monitor in production** with APM tools (New Relic, DataDog, etc.)
5. **Consider total cost** (size, performance, maintenance)

## Adding Custom Benchmarks

### Create New Benchmark Function
Edit `run-benchmarks.sh` and add:

```bash
benchmark_your_test() {
    info "Running your custom benchmark..."

    echo "# Your Benchmark Results" > "$RESULTS_DIR/your-test-$TIMESTAMP.md"
    echo "" >> "$RESULTS_DIR/your-test-$TIMESTAMP.md"

    for tier in slim standard full; do
        IMAGE="phpeek-${tier}"

        # Your test logic here
        RESULT="your_measurement"

        echo "| $tier | $RESULT |" >> "$RESULTS_DIR/your-test-$TIMESTAMP.md"
    done

    success "Your benchmark complete"
}
```

Then call it from `main()`:
```bash
main() {
    # ... existing benchmarks ...
    benchmark_your_test
    generate_summary
}
```

```
