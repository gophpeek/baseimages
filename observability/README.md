# PHPeek Observability

Pre-configured monitoring dashboards and configurations for PHPeek Base Images.

## Grafana Dashboard

### PHPeek PM Process Manager Dashboard

Import `grafana-phpeek-pm-dashboard.json` into Grafana for comprehensive monitoring of:

- **Process Status**: PHP-FPM, Nginx, Horizon, Queue Workers
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU per process
- **Queue Workers**: Scale tracking, restarts, health
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Execution history, success/failure rates
- **Health Checks**: TCP, HTTP, and exec health status

### Quick Import

1. Open Grafana → Dashboards → Import
2. Upload `grafana-phpeek-pm-dashboard.json`
3. Select your Prometheus data source
4. Click Import

### Requirements

- Grafana 10.0+
- Prometheus data source
- PHPeek PM metrics exposed on port 9090

## Prometheus Configuration

Add this scrape config to your `prometheus.yml`:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'phpeek-pm'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['your-app:9090']
    scrape_interval: 15s
    metrics_path: /metrics
```

## Alerting Rules

Example Prometheus alerting rules for PHPeek PM:

```yaml
groups:
  - name: phpeek-pm
    rules:
      - alert: ProcessDown
        expr: phpeek_pm_process_up == 0
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Process {{ $labels.process }} is down"
          description: "Process {{ $labels.process }} on {{ $labels.instance }} has been down for more than 1 minute."

      - alert: HighRestartRate
        expr: increase(phpeek_pm_process_restarts_total[5m]) > 5
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "High restart rate for {{ $labels.process }}"
          description: "Process {{ $labels.process }} has restarted more than 5 times in the last 5 minutes."

      - alert: ScheduledTaskFailed
        expr: phpeek_pm_scheduled_task_last_exit_code != 0
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Scheduled task {{ $labels.task }} failed"
          description: "Scheduled task {{ $labels.task }} has a non-zero exit code."

      - alert: HealthCheckFailing
        expr: phpeek_pm_health_check_status == 0
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Health check failing for {{ $labels.process }}"
          description: "Health check {{ $labels.check_type }} for {{ $labels.process }} has been failing for 2 minutes."
```
